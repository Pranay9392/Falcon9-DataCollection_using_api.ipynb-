# Falcon 9 Data Collection Using API

This repository contains a Python-based project for collecting and analyzing data about Falcon 9 launches using API calls. The collected data is processed and stored in a structured format for further analysis.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to:
1. Collect Falcon 9 launch data through APIs.
2. Extract specific details related to rockets, payloads, launchpads, and cores.
3. Store the extracted information in Pandas DataFrames.
4. Perform data wrangling, including handling missing values and filtering for Falcon 9 launches.
5. Save the processed data into a CSV file for further analysis.

## Features

- Extract detailed information about Falcon 9 launches.
- Organize data into structured Pandas DataFrames.
- Perform data cleaning, including handling missing values.
- Filter for Falcon 9 launches only.
- Export cleaned data to a CSV file.

## Data Extraction Details

The project uses API calls to fetch data about Falcon 9 launches. The extracted details include:

1. **Rocket Information**
   - Booster name.

2. **Payload Information**
   - Payload mass.
   - Orbit.

3. **Launchpad Information**
   - Launch site name.
   - Longitude.
   - Latitude.

4. **Core Information**
   - Outcome of landing.
   - Type of landing.
   - Number of flights with the core.
   - Whether gridfins were used.
   - Whether the core is reused.
   - Whether legs were used.
   - Landing pad used.
   - Block number of the core.
   - Number of times the core has been reused.
   - Serial of the core.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library
- `requests` library
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive exploration)

### Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/falcon9-datacollection-using-api.git
   cd falcon9-datacollection-using-api
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas requests
   ```

3. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the script to generate the Pandas DataFrame and export the data to a CSV file.

## Data Wrangling and Cleaning

- Replaced missing values with the mean value of the respective column.
- Filtered the dataset to include only Falcon 9 launches for specific analysis.

## Output

- The final cleaned and filtered data is exported as a CSV file for further analysis.

## Next Steps

In the next phase, the project will focus on analyzing the data within a pre-selected date range to ensure consistency in results. The dataset will be provided for deeper insights into Falcon 9 launches.
